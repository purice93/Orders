a).Solve the expansion loss: if we know the approximate capacity, set the reasonable initial capacity to solve the expansion loss;
use reasonable hash function:the object is string.

b).Finding the maximum or minimum will be faster£¬but random lookups can be slower¡£

c).TreeMap is the commonly used Map interface implementation class, and TreeSet is the commonly used Set interface implementation class.
the bottom of TreeSet is realized by TreeMap.TreeSet cannot duplicate objects, while TreeMap can exist in.
TreeSet stores only one object, and TreeMap storage two objects Key and Value.
